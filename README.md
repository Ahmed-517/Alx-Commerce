# E-commerce Website

## Introduction

This e-commerce project was built as part of our ALX portfolio to apply the software concepts we've learned throughout our journey. Our primary goal was to deepen our understanding of full-stack web development by creating a fully functional and scalable e-commerce platform. Through this project, we aimed to gain practical experience in both frontend and backend development, while handling crucial aspects like product management, order processing, and user authentication.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Router-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/)

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Usage

This is a fully functional e-commerce website where users can:
- Browse products in a catalog.
- Add items to their shopping cart.
- Authenticate themselves using a secure login system.
- Proceed to checkout for placing orders.

### Features
- **Frontend**: Built using React, Redux Toolkit for state management, and styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Managed using Supabase for database and user authentication.
- **Routing**: React-Router-Dom handles navigation between pages without reloading.

## Project Inspiration & Challenges

We chose to build an e-commerce website because it offered a manageable yet rich learning opportunity. By tackling product management, user authentication, and order processing, we got hands-on experience with real-world web development challenges. Our aim was to not only showcase our skills but also deepen our understanding of full-stack systems.

**Challenges faced:**
- **Learning Curve**: Working with new technologies like React, Redux, and Supabase presented challenges. We spent extra time on tutorials and collaborating closely to overcome knowledge gaps.
- **API Integration**: Integrating authentication and handling API calls between Supabase and React was tricky. We initially faced delays in API responses and data mismatches. Eventually, we created a validation layer to streamline the process.
- **Form Validation & Responsiveness**: Implementing form validation for login was challenging, as incorrect data caused failures. Additionally, ensuring the application was fully responsive across different devices took careful layout design using Tailwind CSS.

**Next Steps**:
- We plan to add features like Stripe for payment integration and email subscriptions to improve the user experience.
- We'll continue optimizing the backend and explore MongoDB with express.js for more scalable database solutions.
